# GNSS ICD

## GPS
* [IS-GPS-200](http://www.gps.gov/technical/icwg/IS-GPS-200G.pdf)  
> Interface Specification IS-GPS-200 defines the requirements related to the interface between the space segment of the Global Positioning System and the navigation user segment of the GPS for radio frequency link 1 (L1) and link 2 (L2). Versions of the document prior to Revision D were designated as ICDs instead of ISs.

* [IS-GPS-705](http://www.gps.gov/technical/icwg/IS-GPS-705C.pdf)  
> Interface Specification IS-GPS-705 defines the requirements related to the interface between the space segment of the Global Positioning System and the navigation user segment of the GPS for radio frequency link 5 (L5).

* [IS-GPS-800](http://www.gps.gov/technical/icwg/IS-GPS-800C.pdf)  
> Interface Specification IS-GPS-800 defines the characteristics of a signal transmitted from GPS satellites to navigation receivers on radio frequency link 1 (L1). While there are multiple signals broadcast within the frequency band of L1, this Interface Specification defines only the signal denoted L1 Civil (L1C).

* [ICD-GPS-870](http://www.gps.gov/technical/icwg/ICD-GPS-870A.pdf)  
> Interface Control Document ICD-GPS-870 defines the functional data transfer interface between the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) and the GPS user and user-support communities. The ICD describes the data files that are transferred in this interface and the means by which they are distributed. ICD-GPS-870 captures the same interface as ICD-GPS-240 (Navstar GPS Control Segment to User Support Community Interfaces), but for the OCX era.
